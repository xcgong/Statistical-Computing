# Statistical-Computing

This is a R project I finished in the course Statistical Computing in spring 2021. I read the paper “Estimating the Complete Sample Size from an Incomplete Poisson Sample” from JASA and wrote R codes to reproduce Monte-Carlo simulations in the paper. 
I give R codes and the report of this course project in this repository.
